- Geography: Multiple stores across regions with store-level data.
- Entities:
  - Sales facts including order ID, date, store, product, customer, quantity, and revenue.
  - Product dimension with category, subcategory, brand, size, and color attributes.
  - Store dimension with location, region, store type, and opening date.
  - Date dimension with standard time attributes like year, quarter, month, week, and day.
  - Customer dimension with customer segment, loyalty status, and demographic signals.
- Metrics include revenue, cost of goods sold, gross profit, gross margin, discounts, net sales, units sold, and return rate.
- Data quality: Data is validated for key constraints, such as non-negative quantities, valid dates, and consistent product IDs across tables. Missing values are flagged, and simple imputation strategies are documented in the data quality section.

Data model and architecture
- Approach: Star schema for fast querying and straightforward maintenance.
- Core tables:
  - FactSales: captures line-level transactions and financials.
  - DimDate: provides consistent time attributes for time-based analysis.
  - DimStore: stores metadata for each location.
  - DimProduct: holds product attributes and category hierarchies.
  - DimCustomer: lists customer attributes and segments.
- Relationships:
  - FactSales to DimDate on order_date_id.
  - FactSales to DimStore on store_id.
  - FactSales to DimProduct on product_id.
  - FactSales to DimCustomer on customer_id.
- Data lineage: Every measure is traceable to the underlying fact data. The model supports advanced time intelligence while preserving accuracy across filters and slicers.
- Modularity: The model is designed for incremental refresh and easy extension. Adding new markets, product lines, or additional facts remains straightforward.

Key measures and DAX expressions
- Total Revenue: SUM(FactSales[Revenue])
- Total Cost: SUM(FactSales[COGS])
- Gross Profit: [Total Revenue] - [Total Cost]
- Gross Margin: DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)
- Units Sold: SUM(FactSales[Quantity])
- Average Order Value (AOV): DIVIDE([Total Revenue], DISTINCTCOUNT(FactSales[OrderID]))
- Customer Count: DISTINCTCOUNT(FactSales[CustomerID])
- Discount Amount: SUM(FactSales[DiscountAmount])
- Net Revenue: [Total Revenue] - [Discount Amount]
- Revenue Growth YoY: CALCULATE([Total Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DimDate[Date]))
- Moving Averages: AVERAGEX(CALCULATE(DISTINCT(DimDate[Date])), [Revenue])
- Time-Intelligence helpers:
  - Period-to-date: TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], DimDate[Date])
  - Quarter-to-date: TOTALQTD([Total Revenue], DimDate[Date])
  - Month-to-date: TOTALMTD([Total Revenue], DimDate[Date])
- Forecasting insertions (time-series):
  - Uses built-in forecasting in Power BI visuals with the date axis and simple trend-based projection. Forecast horizon and confidence bands are configurable per visual.

Time intelligence and forecasting
- Time intelligence: The model treats time as a primary axis for analytics. Power BIâ€™s time-intelligence functions drive KPI calculations and trend analyses.
- Forecasting approach: A practical forecast leverages built-in Power BI forecasting on the time axis. It supports a forecast horizon from 2 to 24 periods, with confidence intervals. The forecast assumes a stable trend but can adapt to seasonal patterns where present in the data.
- Seasonality and cycles: The dashboard allows testing for seasonality by month and quarter. You can decompose seasonality visually and compare year-over-year patterns to identify recurring peaks in holiday periods, promotions, and regional events.
- Forecast validation: Visuals include a forecast with confidence bands. Analysts can adjust the horizon and review historical residuals to understand forecasting accuracy.
- Best practices: For credible forecasts, ensure data completeness for the required periods, maintain a stable data schema, and align your date table with the fiscal calendar if used. Avoid overfitting by keeping the horizon reasonable relative to historical data.

Visual design and interactivity
- Visual toolkit:
  - Time-series line charts showing revenue, units, and gross profit across weeks and months.
  - Stacked and clustered bar charts for category performance and store comparisons.
  - Treemaps showing category contributions to revenue and profit.
  - KPI cards for quick health checks like YoY growth, margin, and AOV.
  - Heat maps for store performance by region and month.
  - Slicers for date ranges, store regions, product categories, and customer segments.
  - Drill-through pages for deep dives into product families or top customers.
- Interactivity:
  - Cross-filtering between visuals ensures a cohesive exploration experience.
  - Highlighting and tooltips provide context for each data point.
  - Bookmarks enable storytelling to present a sequence of insights.
- Accessibility:
  - Color palettes are chosen to support color-vision-deficiency accessibility.
  - Descriptive tooltips explain metrics and how to interpret visuals.
- Storytelling flow:
  - Start with global performance, then drill into growth patterns, product category dynamics, and store-level insights.
  - Highlight key drivers of revenue and margins, followed by customer behavior trends.
  - End with actionable recommendations and forecasted outlooks.

Getting started
- Prerequisites:
  - A modern Windows machine with Power BI Desktop installed (or access to Power BI Service for publishing).
  - A basic understanding of Power BI concepts: relationships, measures, and visuals.

 5. Navigate to the Visuals pane and explore the pre-built dashboards.
- Data refresh:
  - If you maintain a live data source, configure a scheduled refresh in Power BI Service for ongoing insights.
  - For local files, set up a refresh plan to maintain up-to-date numbers after any data changes.

Data loading and transformation
- Power Query Editor workflow:
  - Import data from CSV, Excel, or database sources that match the schema.
  - Cleanse data: trim strings, standardize date formats, and remove duplicates.
  - Create a single date table that aligns with the fact data.
  - Establish relationships in the data model to connect facts with dimensions.
  - Create calculated columns for derived attributes (e.g., month name, quarter).
- Data validation steps:
  - Verify that all date fields map to the date table.
  - Ensure product IDs and store IDs exist in their respective dimension tables.
  - Check consistency between revenue, COGS, and discount fields.
- Reusable templates:
  - The Power Query steps are designed to be portable. You can adapt the same transformation logic to new datasets with similar structures.

Data quality, governance, and security
- Data quality:
  - The pipeline marks missing values in critical fields and logs anomalies.
  - Key constraints ensure non-negative amounts and valid dates.
  - Regular checks catch mismatches between the fact and dimension tables.
- Governance:
  - The model uses role-based access for sensitive fields in the Power BI Service.
  - Data lineage is documented in the docs/ section to aid audit and compliance.
- Security:
